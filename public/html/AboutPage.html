            <p>Study Helper allows students to save important study notes
            in topic, chapter and subject wise. These notes are stored in 
            cloud using firebase real time database. It brings all the related 
            references such as articles and you tube links in a single page. 
            This includes voice input feature so important points can be added 
            through voice while studying. The voice output feature will be useful 
            for poor readers. It automatically reminds the students (through mail) 
            based on their scheduled plan. Students can schedule their plans by 
            selecting the respective time, date, month and year. When the deadline 
            is close, reminder will be send to the student through auto generated 
            mail.</p>
            <p>Study Helper also includes authentication feature so that 
            data of different users are stored separately and securely. 
            Students need their email id and password to access their notes. 
            Any time the students can add, modify or delete their notes. Using 
            this website is simple and straight forward, which makes it more 
            comfortable and time efficient. This website will be developed using 
            HTML, CSS,  Java Script, node JS, mongo DB and firebase cloud service.

            <p>While there are millions of tools on internet to spoil the 
            lives of many students, why there shouldn’t be some tools that 
            will bring back their lives to them.  Modern technology has made 
            us lazy to study hard. Usually when we start to study, we get bored 
            and quit early. Students feel tired of downloading and organizing their 
            study materials. Its difficult to make a collection of important notes 
            for revising later, especially during exams.  Also some students are 
            unaware of their Assignment and quiz deadlines.  These factors will gradually 
            decrease their academic scores. These issues can be fixed by this website 
            called ‘Study Helper’.</p>
            <p>Students can save their study notes subject, chapter and even 
            topic wise, which makes it easier for them to organize their notes. 
            They can schedule their personal plan and deadlines, so that every time 
            a deadline comes close,  automatic reminder will be sent through mail. 
            These habits will surely increase the student’s academic scores gradually.
